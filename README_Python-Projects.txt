##Readme.txt for Stoove's GitHub project "Python Projects".
##This is a series of small projects which I am putting together for two reasons;
##
##-1- I am trying to learn Python
##
##-2- My most fluent language (Matlab) is closed source and I would like to have
##    some of the same functionality in Python once I am unable to pay for a Matlab
##    license
##
##Here, I will try to list the different sub-projects which I am writing.
##
##= HelloWorld.py
##    A simple Hello World program, where I also experimented a little with
##    keyboard shortcuts for commenting
##
##= WorkingOutFunctions.py
##    A script focused on working out how to pass and use function handles in Python,
##    which is a technique I find extremely useful in other languages.
##
##= ExploringLists.py
##    A script in which I take some time for learning lists and their associated
##    weirdness. I was not used to mutable types from Matlab.
